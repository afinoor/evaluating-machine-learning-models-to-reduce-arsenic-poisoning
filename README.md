# Evaluating different machine learning models to aid the initiative of reducing arsenic poisoning
A countrywide drinking water quality assessment completed in 2009 provided information that over the national level of 50 g/L and the World Health Organization's recommendation limit of 10 g/L, respectively, between 20 million and 45 million persons were determined to be exposed to arenic contamination in their drinking water<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>. According to Bangladesh Arsenic Mitigation Water Supply Project (BAMWSP) annual report for 2019-2020 arsenic is present in tube-wells in 61 out of 64 districts <sup>[2](#myfootnote1)</sup>.
