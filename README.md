# Evaluating different machine learning models to aid the initiative of reducing arsenic poisoning
A countrywide drinking water quality assessment completed in 2009 provided information that over the national level of 50 g/L and the World Health Organization's recommendation limit of 10 g/L, respectively, between 20 million and 45 million persons were determined to be exposed to arenic contamination in their drinking water<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>. According to Bangladesh Arsenic Mitigation Water Supply Project (BAMWSP) annual report for 2019-2020 arsenic is present in tube-wells in 61 out of 64 districts <sup>[2](#myfootnote1)</sup>.
<br>
Among the strategies used to combat arsenic poisoning, according to Van Geen's research conducted in Araihazar upazilla of Bangladesh, just testing well water and informing people about the dangers of arsenic poisoning may persuade 60 percent of individuals to switch to lower-arsenic water sources. <b>This method costs under $1 per person, which is significantly cheaper comparing to drilling private medium-depth wells that costs $28 per person<sup>[3](#myfootnote1)</sup>.</b>
<br>
<br>
<b> Objective of this project: </b> To evaluate different machine learning models and suggest the optimum one to help predict the approximately 40% families that won't switch wells even after encouragement (according to Van Geen's research about 60% families switches).
